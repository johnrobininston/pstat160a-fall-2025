Welcome to my repository for my course materials for PSTAT160A Stochastic Processes 
provided by Prof. Tomoyuki Ichiba at UC Santa Barbara in Fall 2025.  

These materials typically consist of my personal lecture notes, section work sheets
and model solutions.  A majority of the problems were taken from the textbook 
[Introduction to Stochastic Processes with `R`](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118740712) 
written by Robert P. Dobrow.

If you find any errors in my solutions please feel free to reach out to me, my contact
information can be found on my [personal website](https://johnrobininston.com).

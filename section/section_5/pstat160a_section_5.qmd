## Problem 1 - Dobrow 3.29

Consider the Markov Chain (MC) with transition probability matrix
$$
P=\begin{bmatrix}
0.6 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 0.2 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
0 & 0 & 0.3 & 0.7 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0.3 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0.1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.9  \\
0 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.8 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Identify the communication classes.  Classify the states as recurrent or transient, and determine the period of each state.

## Problem 2 - Dobrow 3.46

Given a MC with transition matrix $P$ and stationary distribution $\pi$, the time reversal is a Markov chain with transition matrix $\tilde{P}$ defined by
$$
\tilde{P_{i,j}}=\frac{{\pi_{j}P_{j,i}}}{\pi_{i}},
$$
for all $i,j\in \mathcal{S}$.

1. Show that a Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ is reversible if and only if $P=\tilde{P}$.
2. Show that the time reversal Markov chain has the same stationary distribution as the original one.

## Problem 3 - Dobrow 3.52

The board for a modified Snakes and Ladder game is shown in Figure 1 below. The game is played with a tetrahedron (4-sided) die.

1. Find the expected length of the game.
2. Assume that the player is on square 6.  Find the probability that they will find themselves at square 3 before finishing the game.

## Problem 4 - Dobrow 3.57

In repeated coin flips consider the set of all 3-element patterns
$$
\{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}.
$$

Which patterns take the longest time, on average, to appear in repeated sampling? Which take the shortest?

## Problem 5 - Dobrow 3.64

The evolution of forest ecosystems in the United States and Canada is studied in Strigul et al. (2012) using Markov chains.  Five-year changes in the state of the forest soil are modeled with a 12-state Markov chain.  The transition matrix can be found in the `R`-script file `forest.R`.  About how many years does it take for the ecosystem to move from state 1 to state 12?
